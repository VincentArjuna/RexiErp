- **Rate Limiting**: Redis-based (Redis 7.2.5 available from story 1.1)
- **Logging**: Structured JSON logs integrating with Logrus stack
- **API Documentation**: Swagger/OpenAPI 3.0 served as static files
- **SSL/TLS**: Nginx native SSL termination
- **Configuration**: Nginx configuration files with environment-specific overrides

### Nginx Configuration Structure
**Configuration Files Location:**
- **Main config**: `deployments/docker-compose/nginx/nginx.conf` (from Story 1.1)

- **SSL certificates**: `deployments/docker-compose/nginx/ssl/`
- **Static files**: `deployments/docker-compose/nginx/static/` (for Swagger UI)

**Upstream Services to Route To:**
Based on microservice architecture from Story 1.1:
- Authentication Service: http://authentication-service:8081

- Support burst capacity and nodelay options
- Include rate limit headers in responses via `add_header`

**2. Request Logging Configuration:**
- Generate unique request IDs using `$request_id`

- Health check pass-through to actual services

### API Versioning Strategy
**URL Structure:**
- `/api/v1/` - Current stable API version routing
- Support for multiple API versions simultaneously
- Graceful version deprecation through headers

**Nginx Location Block Configuration:**
```nginx
location /api/v1/ {
    # API version 1 routing rules
    proxy_pass http://upstream_services;
    # Version-specific headers and handling
}
```

### Swagger UI Integration
**Documentation Requirements:**

    "message": "Human readable error message",
    "details": {},
    "request_id": "$request_id",
    "timestamp": "$time_iso8601"
  }
}
```

### Testing
**Nginx Configuration Testing Requirements:**
