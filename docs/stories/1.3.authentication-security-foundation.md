### Security Requirements
**Authentication & Authorization** [Source: architecture/security.md#authentication-authorization]
- Auth Method: JWT tokens with refresh token rotation
- Session Management: Redis-based session store with configurable TTL
- Required Patterns:
  - JWT signed with RS256 keys
  - Role-based access control (RBAC) with tenant context
  - Multi-factor authentication for admin users

**Password Security** [Source: architecture/security.md#input-validation]
- Password hashing using bcrypt
- Input validation at service boundaries
- Indonesian phone number validation (+62 format)
- Indonesian email domain validation

**API Security** [Source: architecture/security.md#api-security]
- Rate limiting: Redis-based rate limiting with configurable rules per endpoint
- Security headers: Strict-Transport-Security, X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options
- HTTPS enforcement in production

### Technical Constraints
**Technology Stack** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#technology-stack-table]
- Go 1.23.1 for development language
- Gin 1.9.1 for HTTP web framework
- GORM 1.25.10 for database ORM
- PostgreSQL 16.6 for primary relational database
- Redis 7.2.5 for caching and session store
- JWT 1.2.1 for token-based authentication

**Coding Standards** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-rules]
- No hardcoded secrets: Use environment variables or configuration service only
- Tenant context required: All database operations must include tenant isolation
- Error wrapping: Use fmt.Errorf with context, never use bare errors.New
- Structured logging: Use Logrus with consistent field names across services
- Input validation: Validate all external inputs at service boundaries
- Repository pattern: All database access through repository interfaces
- Context propagation: Always pass context parameter through function chains

### Testing Requirements

**Testing Standards** [Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md#testing-philosophy]
- Approach: Test-driven development with 80% unit coverage, integration tests for critical paths
- Coverage Goals: 80% unit test coverage, 100% for authentication operations
- Test Pyramid: 70% unit tests, 20% integration tests, 10% end-to-end tests

**Unit Tests** [Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md#unit-tests]
- Framework: Go's built-in testing package with testify 1.9.0
- File Convention: *_test.go files alongside source files
- Location: Same package as source code
- Mocking Library: testify/mock and gomock for external dependencies
- Coverage Requirement: 80% minimum, 95% for authentication operations

**Integration Tests** [Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md#integration-tests]
- Scope: Database operations, Redis caching, external API integrations
- Location: tests/integration/
- Test Infrastructure:
  - PostgreSQL: Testcontainers PostgreSQL for integration tests
  - Redis: Testcontainers Redis for caching tests

**AI Agent Testing Requirements:**
- Generate tests for all public methods
- Cover edge cases and error conditions
- Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
- Mock all external dependencies (database, Redis, RabbitMQ, external APIs)
- Test multi-tenant data isolation
- Test security scenarios (invalid tokens, expired sessions, etc.)

### Project Structure Notes
The authentication service must follow the established monorepo structure with proper separation of concerns. All code should be placed in the `internal/authentication/` directory following the layered architecture pattern (handler -> service -> repository -> model).
