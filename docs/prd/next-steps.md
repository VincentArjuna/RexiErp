## Architect Prompt

**To: Architect Agent**
**Subject: RexiERP Architecture Design**

Please review the RexiERP Product Requirements Document (docs/prd.md) and create comprehensive technical architecture covering:

1. **Microservices Architecture Design** - Detailed service boundaries, communication patterns, and data flows
2. **API Design Specifications** - RESTful API standards, authentication patterns, and OpenAPI documentation structure
3. **Database Architecture** - Multi-tenant data isolation, schema design, and migration strategies
4. **Infrastructure Architecture** - Cloud-agnostic deployment patterns, scalability approaches, and disaster recovery
5. **Security Architecture** - Authentication, authorization, data encryption, and compliance controls
6. **Integration Architecture** - Indonesian API integrations (e-Faktur, BPJS, banks), webhook systems, and third-party connections
7. **Performance Architecture** - Caching strategies, optimization patterns, and monitoring approaches

Focus on Indonesian compliance requirements, zero-cost technology stack, and API-first backend architecture. The system must support 1,000+ MSME deployments with cloud-agnostic deployment capabilities.
