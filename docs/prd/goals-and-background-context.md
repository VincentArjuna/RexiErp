# Goals and Background Context

## Goals

- Deliver zero-cost microservices ERP solution for Indonesian MSMEs, eliminating licensing fees while maintaining enterprise-grade functionality
- Achieve cloud-agnostic deployment capability across AWS, Azure, GCP, or on-premises infrastructure
- Establish comprehensive Indonesian compliance features including PPn 11% tax handling and SAK accounting standards
- Enable rapid implementation (<2 weeks) with API-first architecture for seamless integrations
- Build sustainable open-source ecosystem supporting 1,000+ MSME deployments within 24 months

## Background Context

RexiERP addresses the critical gap in Indonesian MSME market where 64 million businesses representing 97% of domestic companies and 60.7% of GDP contribution struggle with ERP accessibility. Current solutions force unacceptable trade-offs: international ERPs (SAP, Oracle) cost $1,000-2,500 per user monthly, while local alternatives create cloud lock-in and lack API-first integration capabilities. This creates a competitive disadvantage for Indonesian MSMEs who need modern, compliant, and flexible ERP systems without prohibitive costs or technical constraints.

The solution leverages zero-cost open-source infrastructure with Go-based microservices to deliver enterprise functionality across accounting, inventory, HR & payroll, tax compliance, and reporting domains. By focusing on Indonesian business requirements including multi-warehouse inventory, BPJS calculations, and PPn 11% compliance, RexiERP provides localized value while maintaining deployment flexibility that international competitors cannot match.
