# Project Brief: RexiERP

<!-- Powered by BMADâ„¢ Core -->

## Executive Summary

**RexiERP** is a cloud-agnostic zero-cost microservices ERP backend for Indonesian micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs), addressing the critical gap where 64 million MSMEs struggle with high-cost ERP solutions like SAP and Oracle while local alternatives are often cloud-locked or expensive. The platform provides comprehensive accounting, inventory, HR & payroll, tax compliance, and reporting capabilities as a self-hosted, API-first solution built entirely on zero-cost open-source infrastructure.

**Key Value Proposition:** Free software with no licensing fees, deployment flexibility across any cloud provider (AWS, Azure, GCP) or on-premises, and comprehensive functionality tailored to Indonesian business needs including PPn 11% tax compliance and Mekari integration.

## Problem Statement

### Current State and Pain Points
- **Prohibitive Costs**: Major ERP solutions (SAP, Oracle) cost $1,000-2,500 per user monthly - completely inaccessible for Indonesian MSMEs
- **Cloud Lock-in**: Local solutions like Mekari, JojoWay require specific cloud providers, limiting flexibility
- **Integration Complexity**: Existing systems lack API-first design, making integration with existing tools difficult
- **Regulatory Compliance Gap**: Many solutions don't properly handle Indonesian tax requirements (PPn 11%, PPh 21, 23, 26)
- **Feature Bloat**: Enterprise ERPs include unnecessary complexity for small business needs
- **Technical Debt**: Legacy systems are difficult to maintain and scale

### Impact and Urgency
- **Market Size**: 64 million Indonesian MSMEs representing 97% of domestic businesses
- **Economic Impact**: MSMEs contribute 60.7% to Indonesia's GDP
- **Competitive Disadvantage**: Businesses without proper ERP systems struggle with efficiency and compliance
- **Digital Transformation Gap**: Post-COVID acceleration makes modern ERP systems essential
